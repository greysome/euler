Notes:

- Solutions are not guaranteed to be readable. My focus is to solve
  problems, not to write pretty code. I do document my solution in
  comments sometimes.
- If a solution for a certain problem is not present, either I haven't
  solved it, or I solved it by hand.
- To decrypt solutions for problems past 100, run `gpg --batch --yes --passphrase <answer> -d -o <output file> <solution file>`
